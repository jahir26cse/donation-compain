1. Clicking on Donation Cards:
 We provide clicking-on donation cards to show helpful information on each donation card. It helps the users to get all the detailed and relevant information related to the purpose of the donation and its basic information.

These appropriate features help in communicating and helping in the successful management of the donation project and connecting with the users.


2. Local Storage Data:
 We load data using local storage, showing it on all donation pages. It stores donation information locally on the user's device, so that donation information is known during subsequent rebuilds.

3. Statistic Page: 
Our donation camp project comes with a statistics page, showing the overall donation statistics and social impact. This page supports reviewing the amount and overall donation history, which has been given by contributors.
